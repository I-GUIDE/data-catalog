# Core Metadata

Core metadata is a set of common metadata fields that all catalog
holdings share and consists largely of high-level dataset attributes
and properties. This document outlines the **required** and **optional**
high-level properties selected from Schema.Org vocabulary to design the 
I-GUIDE core metadata schema. These properties are encoded as `1` or `1+` 
for **required** and `0,1` or `0+` for **optional** in the Cardinality column of the table below.

|Property|Class|Expected Type|Cardinality|Description| 
|---|---|---|---|---|
|[name](#name-description-and-url)|Thing|Text|1|The name or title of the record|
|[description](#name-description-and-url)|Thing|Text|1|The description or abstract of the record|

|[citation](#citation)|CreativeWork|CreativeWork \| Text|0+|A citation or reference to another creative work|

The following examples demonstrate how each one of these properties may
be implemented in JSON+LD. Note that there are several properties omitted from each
example such as `@context` and `@type`. 

### Name, Description, and URL
[Schema:name](https://schema.org/name), [Schema:description](https://schema.org/description), 
and [Schema:url](https://schema.org/url) are properties inherited from the
Schema.Org `Thing` class. These are common properties that all Schema.Org types
contain. 

A simple example is shown below:

``` json
{
  "name": "I-GUIDE Dataset Catalog Example",
  "description": "This resource contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how someone can query the I-GUIDE data catalog, retrieve data, and execute a code workflow.",
  "url": "https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/018fe11a7f644bc2bc82f9ec073eeca9/"
}
```

### Identifier

[Schema:identifier](https://schema.org/identifier) is a property of the `Thing` class. It is used to encode the record's identifier(s). For permanently published records, `identifier` will likely be a digital object identifier (DOI). For unpublished records, this may be an identifier assigned by the system in which the record's content resides. This element can be repeated if a record has multiple identifiers.

An identifier as text can be encoded as:

``` json
{
  "identifier": "6625bdbde41c45c2b906f32be7ea70f0/"
}
```

However, it is preferred for an identifier to be expressed as a URL if possible. The following example illustrates how an identifier can be encoded as a URL. In this example, the identifier is the unique ID of the creative work generated by the HydroShare system, where the content of the record resides. 

``` json
{
  "identifier": "https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/6625bdbde41c45c2b906f32be7ea70f0/"
}
```

[Science On Schema.Org (SOSO)](https://github.com/ESIPFed/science-on-schema.org/blob/master/guides/Dataset.md#identifier) recommends that if the identifier is a persistent identifier such as a DOI, the best way to represent the identifer is to use [schema:ProperatyValue](https://schema.org/PropertyValue). The identifier for a published record with a DOI can be encoded as:

``` json
{
  "identifier": {
    "@id": "https://doi.org/10.4211/hs.6625bdbde41c45c2b906f32be7ea70f0",
    "@type": "PropertyValue",
    "name": "DOI: 10.4211/hs.6625bdbde41c45c2b906f32be7ea70f0",
    "propertyID": "https://registry.identifiers.org/registry/doi",
    "value": "doi:10.4211/hs.6625bdbde41c45c2b906f32be7ea70f0",
    "url": "https://doi.org/10.4211/hs.6625bdbde41c45c2b906f32be7ea70f0"
  }
}
```
Please note that the example above describes the use of the `PropertyValue` type to represent the `identifier`. It is important to mention that our current schema does not currently include the `identifier` as a `PropertyValue` type. However, we may consider incorporating it in future updates of our schema.

### Creator 

[Schema:creator](https://schema.org/creator) is a property of the `CreativeWork` class. The purpose of `creator`
property is to describe the author or authors of a catalog record. The
recommended way to express authorship of a CreativeWork is shown below. Note that
this approach was adopted from ESIP SOSO.

A single author can be expressed as:

``` json
{
  "creator": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@email.com"
  }
}
```

A single organization can be represented as:

``` json
{
  "creator": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)",
    "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/",
    "address": "300 E Street SW Washington, DC 20546-0001"
  }
} 
```

A more complete example of an author will include additional fields from the
[Schema:Person](https://schema.org/Person) class such as an identifier.

``` json
{
  "creator": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@noaa.gov",
    "affiliation": {
      "@type": "Organization",
      "name": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)",
      "url": "https://www.noaa.gov/",
      "address": "1401 Constitution Avenue NW, Room 5128, Washington, DC 20230"
    },
    "identifier": "https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0001"
  }
}
```

For multiple authors, the `@list` keyword is used to preserve the order of creators.

``` json
{
  "creator": {
    "@list":[
      {
        "@type": "Person",
        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "john.doe@noaa.gov",
        "affiliation": {
          "@type": "Organization",
          "name": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)",
          "url": "https://www.noaa.gov/",
          "address": "1401 Constitution Avenue NW, Room 5128, Washington, DC 20230"
        },
        "identifier": "https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0001"
      },
      {
        "@type": "Person",
        "name": "Jane Doe",
        "email": "jane.doe@email.com",
        "affiliation": {
          "@type": "Organization",
          "name": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)",
          "url": "https://www.noaa.gov/",
          "address": "1401 Constitution Avenue NW, Room 5128, Washington, DC 20230"
        },
        "identifier": "https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0002"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Dates

[Schema:dateCreated](https://schema.org/dateCreated), 
[Schema:dateModified](https://schema.org/dateModified), and 
[Schema:datePublished](https://schema.org/datePublished) are properties of 
`CreativeWork` that can be expressed using either the [Schema:Date](https://schema.org/Date) 
or [Schema:DateTime](https://schema.org/DateTime)  data types. 
The **dateCreated** represents the date at which the dataset was initially generated. 
The **dateModified** represents the date at which the dataset was most recently modified. 
The **datePublished** represents the date on which the dataset was permanently published. 
The `Date` class expects a value in [ISO 8601 date format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601), whereas the `DateTime` class requires a combination of date and time of day. An example of each is provided below.

``` json
{
  "dateCreated": "2020-10-01",
  "dateModified": "2022-11-24",
  "datePublished": "2023-02-02"
}
```

``` json
{
  "dateCreated": "2020-10-01T00:00:00+00:00",
  "dateModified": "2022-11-24T00:00:00+00:00",
  "datePublished": "2023-02-02T00:00:00+00:00"
}
```

### Keywords

[Schema:keywords](https://schema.org/keywords) is a property of `CreativeWork` that can be expressed using either
the [Schema:DefinedTerm](https://schema.org/DefinedTerm), `Text`, or `URL` Schema.Org classes. Keywords are tags that describe the catalog record and are primarily used for resource discovery. The
**Keywords** property is typically provided as a list of items, but it can also be presented by
repeating the **Keyword** property. Several examples are listed below.

``` json
{
  "keywords": ["keyword 1", "keyword 2", "keyword 3"]
}
```

``` json
{
  "keywords": {
    "@type": "DefinedTerm",
    "name": "Leaf wetness",
    "description": "The effect of moisture settling on the surface of a leaf as a result of either condensation or rainfall.",
    "inDefinedTermSet": "http://his.cuahsi.org/mastercvreg/edit_cv11.aspx?tbl=VariableNameCV"
  }
}
```

``` json
{
  "keywords": [
    {
      "@type": "DefinedTerm",
      "name": "Leaf wetness",
      "description": "The effect of moisture settling on the surface of a leaf as a result of either condensation or rainfall.",
      "inDefinedTermSet": "http://his.cuahsi.org/mastercvreg/edit_cv11.aspx?tbl=VariableNameCV"
    },
    {
      "@type": "DefinedTerm",
      "name": "Core",
      "description": "Core sample resulting in a section of a substance",
      "inDefinedTermSet": "http://his.cuahsi.org/mastercvreg/edit_cv11.aspx?tbl=SampleTypeCV"
    }
  ]
}
```

### License 

[Schema:license](https://schema.org/license) is a property of the `CreativeWork` class and can be expressed as
another `CreativeWork` or `URL`. A license is a document that applies to
the content of the catalog record, for example, a software license. 

``` json
{
  "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"
}
```

SOSO recommends that the license be drawn from the [SPDX license list](https://spdx.org/licenses/). For example, the MIT license 
can be represented as: 

``` json
{
  "license": {
    "@type": "CreativeWork",
    "name": "MIT License",
    "url": "https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT"
    }
}
```

### Provider and Publisher

[Schema:provider](https://schema.org/provider) and [Schema:publisher](https://schema.org/publisher) are properties of the `CreativeWork` class that can be expressed as either an [Schema:Organization](https://schema.org/Organization) or a 
[Schema:Person](https://schema.org/Person). **Provider** represents the service operator,
service performer, or goods producer. In many cases, this is the operator of the
repository in which the data resides, but that may not always be the case. If a record is 
permanently published, **Publisher** indicates the organization or person that published the record.

**Provider** and **Publisher** are semantically similar and can be encoded similarly. The following 
examples are for the **Provider** property but can also be used for **Publisher**.

Simple encoding for the URL of a provider:

``` json
{
  "provider": {
    "@id": "https://hydroshare.org"
  }
}
```

Example encoding where a person is the provider:

``` json
{
  "provider": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "jdoe@noaa.gov",
    "affiliation": {
      "@type": "Organization",
      "name": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)",
      "url": "https://www.noaa.gov/",
      "address": "1401 Constitution Avenue NW, Room 5128, Washington, DC 20230"
    }
  }
}
```

Note: for a more complete example of `Person`, see the [Creator](#creator)
section of this document.

Encoding for a formal repository with a parent organization:

``` json
{
  "provider": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "HydroShare",
    "url": "https://hydroshare.org",
    "parentOrganization": {
      "@type": "Organization",
      "name": "CUAHSI",
      "url": "https://www.cuahsi.org/",
      "address": "1167 Massachusetts Ave Suites 418 & 419, Arlington, MA 02476"
    }
  }
}
```

### Subject Of

[Schema:subjectOf](https://schema.org/subjectOf) is a property of `CreativeWork` and can be used to encode a linkage
to a separate `CreativeWork` that describes or is about the record. An example would 
be a formal metadata document encoded using some metadata standard that fully describes
the record. More specifically, this could be a metadata document accompanying a
geospatial dataset, or a formal metadata document accompanying a HydroShare resource. 
The document describing the record can be available anywhere on the Internet.
The encodingFormat property should indicate the format of the related `CreativeWork`. 
This linkage can be encoded as:

``` json
{
  "subjectOf": {
    "@type": "CreativeWork",
    "name": "Dublin Core Metadata Document Describing the Dataset",
    "url": "https://www.hydroshare.org/hsapi/resource/c1be74eeea614d65a29a185a66a7552f/scimeta/",
    "encodingFormat": "application/rdf+xml"
  }
}
```

Here is an example that demonstrates the utilization of the `subjectOf` property to reference a journal paper describing a particular resource:

```json
{
  "subjectOf": {
    "@type": "CreativeWork",
      "name" : "Simulating storm surge and compound flooding events with a creek-to-ocean model: Importance of baroclinic effects",
      "identifier" : "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2019.101526",
      "url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1463500319302173?via%3Dihub",
      "creator" : {
        "@type" : "Person",
        "name": "Fei Ye",
        "email": "feiye@vims.edu",
        "affiliation": {
          "@type": "Organization",
          "name": "Virginia Institute of Marine Science",
          "url": "https://www.vims.edu",
          "address": "Post Office Box 1346, 1370 Greate Road, Gloucester Point, Virginia 23062-1346"
        }
      }
  }
}
```

### Version

The [Schema:version](https://schema.org/version) is a property of `CreativeWork` that can be used to encode a formal 
version number or name for a record. **version** can be encoded as either a number or
a string; however, since many people use semantic versioning, a string is preferred as
it will work regardless. 

Example encoding as a string:

``` json
{
  "version": "v1.0.2"
}
```


### Language

The [Schema:inLanguage](https://schema.org/inLanguage) property can be used to encode the language in which the record's content 
is expressed. Language codes from the [IETF BCP 47 standard]() should be 
used for this encoding. For most records, it is anticipated that this will be "en-US".

``` json
{
  "inLanguage": "en-US"
}
```


### Creative Work Status

[Schema:creativeWorkStatus](https://schema.org/creativeWorkStatus) is a property of `CreativeWork` used to capture the
stage of a work's lifecycle. Example terms include Incomplete, Draft, Obsolete, and Published. 

``` json
{
  "creativeWorkStatus": {
    "@type": "DefinedTerm",
    "name": "Incomplete",
    "description": "Data collection is ongoing or the resource is not completed."
  }
}

{
  "creativeWorkStatus": {
    "@type": "DefinedTerm",
    "name": "Draft",
    "description": "The resource is in draft state and should not be considered final. Content and metadata may change."
  }
}

{
  "creativeWorkStatus": {
    "@type": "DefinedTerm",
    "name": "Obsolete",
    "description": "The resource has been replaced by a newer version, or the resource is no longer considered applicable."
  }
}

{
  "creativeWorkStatus": {
    "@type": "DefinedTerm",
    "name": "published",
    "description": "The resource has been permanently published and should be considered final and complete."
  }
}
```

### Funding

[Schema:funding](https://schema.org/funding) is a property of the `CreativeWork` class used to describe the
grant(s) that directly or indirectly funded or sponsored the work. **Funding**
is expressed using the [Schema:Grant](https://schema.org/Grant) subtype. SOSO recommends using structural 
information about the funding organization, including its `name` and `identifier`, such as  
[ROR](https://ror.org/) and Funder ID. 

Here is an example of describing the National Science Foundation agency using the `funding` property:

``` json
{
  "funding": {
    "@type": "MonetaryGrant",
    "name": "HDR Institute: Geospatial Understanding through an Integrative Discovery Environment",
    "description": "This project establishes the Institute for Geospatial Understanding through an Integrative Discovery Environment (I-GUIDE). In today's interconnected world, disasters such as floods and droughts are rarely isolated events, and their cascading effects are often felt far beyond their locations of origin. I-GUIDE creates an integrative discovery environment that enables the harnessing of geospatial data for understanding interconnected interactions across diverse socioeconomic-environmental systems to enhance community resilience and environmental sustainability. I-GUIDE nurtures a diverse and inclusive geospatial discovery community across many disciplines by bridging disciplinary digital data divides with broader impacts amplified through a well-trained and diverse workforce and proactive engagement of minority and underrepresented groups. The project leverages existing collaborations with its diverse member and partner organizations, representing academic, governmental, and industrial institutions, thereby extending its reach across the U.S. and the globe. The influence of I-GUIDE?s new knowledge frontiers impact solutions to real-world problems and geospatial decisions, with significance ranging from the nation?s economic development to security. I-GUIDE builds upon relationships with the museum and informal science education communities as well as libraries and news media to raise public awareness about the contributions of the geospatial data revolution to society. Globalization has intensified and extended the impacts of socioeconomic-environmental interactions across long distances, a process known as telecoupling. I-GUIDE?s integrative discovery environment is vital to transform innovative theories, concepts, methods, and tools focusing geospatial synthesis that drive novel capabilities for addressing scientific questions of how to harness geospatial data for multi-scale and telecoupling discoveries to enhance community resilience and environmental sustainability. Two substantive and convergent scientific problems are addressed: (1) Water security, to evaluate geospatial and socioeconomic impacts of hydroclimatic extremes that are related to environmental and infrastructure sustainability, and (2) Biodiversity and food security, to enhance basic understanding of biodiversity dynamics in the face of nearby and distant disasters, global changes, international trade, and dynamic land use transitions. Transformative geospatial understanding gained from solving these interrelated problems are translated into digital resources and tools made available online through an open I-GUIDE platform for a variety of educational and training activities to serve a broad and diverse audience. Through this platform, the next-generation workforce can acquire geospatial knowledge coupled with data-driven technological skills for decision-making and problem-solving experiences. This project is part of the National Science Foundation's Big Idea activities in Harnessing the Data Revolution (HDR). The award by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure is jointly supported by the Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences, the Division of Social and Economic Sciences, and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities within the Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences; the Division of Earth Sciences within the Directorate for Geosciences; the Division of Mathematical Sciences within the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, and by the Division of Information and Intelligent Systems within the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering.",

       ]
    }
  }
  ]
}
```

### Temporal Coverage

[Schema:temporalCoverage](https://schema.org/temporalCoverage) is a property of the `CreativeWork` class that 
defines the period to which the catalog record applies. This should be
expressed using the [Schema:DateTime](https://schema.org/DateTime) subtype.

``` json
{
  "temporalCoverage": {
    "@type": "DateTime",
    "startDate": "2007-03-01T13:00:00Z",
    "endDate": "2008-05-11T15:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

### Spatial Coverage

[Schema:spatialCoverage](https://schema.org/spatialCoverage) is a property of the `CreativeWork` 
class used to indicate the focus area of the record's content and to document the location for which the record's content is valid.
This should be expressed using the [Schema:Place](https://schema.org/Place) subtype. 
There are numerous ways to describe the spatial coverage of a record's content, but below are several common ones.

A generic location may look like this:

``` json 
{
  "spatialCoverage": {
    "@type": "Place",
    "name": "Great Basins"
  }
}
```

However, a recommended practice is to use the [Schema:geo](https://schema.org/geo) that is a subtype of `Place` and 
could be specified by using either [Schema:GeoCoordinates](https://schema.org/GeoCoordinates) for a point location or 
[Schema:GeoShape](https://schema.org/GeoShape) for a line or area coverage extent (such as bounding box, polygon, etc.). 
Note that the geometry described by `GeoShape` should be expressed with a set of latitude and longitude pairs. 

A geographic point location may look like this (from [SOSO](https://github.com/ESIPFed/science-on-schema.org/blob/master/guides/Dataset.md#spatial-coverage)):

``` json

```

A geographic vector is expressed using [Schema:line](https://schema.org/line), and it may look like this (from [SOSO](https://github.com/ESIPFed/science-on-schema.org/blob/master/guides/Dataset.md#spatial-coverage)):

``` json 
{
  "spatialCoverage": {
    "@type": "Place",
    "geo": {
      "@type": "GeoShape",
      "line": "39.3280 120.1633 40.445 123.7878"
    }
  }
}
```

A geographic polygon is described using [Schema:polygon](https://schema.org/polygon), and it may look like this (from [SOSO](https://github.com/ESIPFed/science-on-schema.org/blob/master/guides/Dataset.md#spatial-coverage)):

``` json 
{
  "spatialCoverage": {
    "@type": "Place",
    "geo": {
      "@type": "GeoShape",
      "polygon": "39.3280 120.1633 40.445 123.7878 41 121 39.77 122.42 39.3280 120.1633"
    }
  }
}
```

A geographic bounding box is an area enclosed by a rectangle formed by two points. It is expressed using 
[Schema:box](https://schema.org/box), and it may look like this (from [SOSO](https://github.com/ESIPFed/science-on-schema.org/blob/master/guides/Dataset.md#spatial-coverage)):

``` json
{
  "spatialCoverage": {
    "@type": "Place",
    "geo": {
      "@type": "GeoShape",
      "box": "39.3280 120.1633 40.445 123.7878"
    }
  }
}
```

Multiple locations can be specified using a list: (from [SOSO](https://github.com/ESIPFed/science-on-schema.org/blob/master/guides/Dataset.md#spatial-coverage)):

``` json
{
  "spatialCoverage": {
    "@type": "Place",
    "geo": [
      {
        "@type": "GeoCoordinates",
        "latitude": -17.65,
        "longitude": 50
      },
      {
        "@type": "GeoCoordinates",
        "latitude": -19,
        "longitude": 51
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Associated Media

[Schema:associatedMedia](https://schema.org/associatedMedia), which is also a synonym for 
[Schema:encoding](https://schema.org/encoding), is a property of `CreativeWork` for describing media objects 
that encode the work. Specific types of media objects that we selected for the I-GUIDE 
data catalog are [Schema:DataDownload](https://schema.org/DataDownload), [Schema:ImageObject](https://schema.org/ImageObject), and [Schema:VideoObject](https://schema.org/VideoObject). Note that a media object 
could have several properties from `CreativeWork`, but most importantly, it requires 
[Schema:contentUrl](https://schema.org/contentUrl) and [Schema:encodingFormat](https://schema.org/encodingFormat). 
`contentUrl` should point at the actual bytes of the media object and is represented as a URL. 
`encodingFormat` expresses the format of a media object using a MIME format 
(see [IANA site](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml) and 
[MDN reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types)). 

A single text file that represents the data that is being cataloged can be expressed as:

``` json
{
 "associatedMedia": {
    "@type": "DataDownload",
    "contentUrl": "https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/51d1539bf6e94b15ac33f7631228118c/data/contents/USGS_Harvey_gages_TxLaMsAr.csv",
    "encodingFormat": "text/csv",
    "contentSize": "0.17 MB",
    "name": "USGS gage locations within the Harvey-affected areas in Texas"
  }
}
```

``` json
{
 "associatedMedia": {
    "@type": "VideoObject",
    "contentUrl": "https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/81cb3f6c0dde4433ae4f43a26a889864/data/contents/HydroClientMovie.mp4",
    "encodingFormat": "video/mp4",
    "contentSize": "79.2 MB",
    "name": "HydroClient Video"
  }
}
```

Multiple files can be expressed as:

``` json
{
  "associatedMedia": [
   {
    "@type": "DataDownload",
    "contentUrl": "https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/51d1539bf6e94b15ac33f7631228118c/data/contents/USGS_Harvey_gages_TxLaMsAr.csv",
    "encodingFormat": "text/csv",
    "contentSize": "0.17 MB",
    "name": "USGS gage locations within the Harvey-affected areas in Texas"
   },
   {
     "@type": "DataDownload",
     "contentUrl": "https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/51d1539bf6e94b15ac33f7631228118c/data/contents/USGS_gage_discharge_timeseries.zip",
     "encodingFormat": "application/zip",
     "contentSize": "8.9 MB",
     "name": "Discharge timeseries for the USGS gages located in the Harvey-affected areas in Texas"
   },
   {
     "@type": "ImageObject",
     "contentUrl": "https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/51d1539bf6e94b15ac33f7631228118c/data/contents/USGS-NWS%20gages%20in%20Harvey%20study%20area.png",
     "encodingFormat": "image/png",
     "contentSize": "0.96 MB",
     "name": "USGS-NWS gages in Harvey study area"
   }
  ]
}
```

### Has part and is part of

Collections of records can be expressed using the [Schema:hasPart](https://schema.org/hasPart) (and inverse
[Schema:isPartOf](https://schema.org/isPartOf)) properties of `CreativeWork`. These properties are used to show 
specific relationships between a collection record and its member records where 
`hasPart` is used on the collection to indicate that it contains other records, and 
`isPartOf` is used on a collected record to indicate that it is part of a collection. 
The [Schema:identifier](https://schema.org/identifier) property is used to uniquely identify each record. Note that
the `identifier` property should be programmatically generated when the record is registered into the catalog. For more 
information about `identifier`, see the [Identifier](#identifier) 

**Has Part** describes a record or work that is part of the current
record. For example, a body of work may consist of multiple related datasets that
are used for a particular study.

Note: `hasPart` and `isPartOf` are generally used to link records that are grouped
together or those that belong to other groupings. For example, `hasPart` may
be used to indicate a record that consists of one or more additional
`CreativeWork` (this is similar to a HydroShare collection). In contrast,
`isPartOf` is used to indicate catalog records that reference a designated
`CreativeWork`. 

The following example illustrates how a `CreativeWork` may reference another
`CreativeWork` in the catalog. This can be read as: "Collection of Great Salt Lake Data" 
is a collection of record(s) that includes the "Great Salt Lake Bathymetry" record.

``` json
{
  "@type": "CreativeWork",
  "name": "Collection of Great Salt Lake Data",
  "description": "Data from the Great Salt Lake and its basin",
  "identifier": "https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/b6c4fcad40c64c4cb4dd7d4a25d0db6e/",
  "creator":{
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "David Tarboton",
    "email": "david.tarboton@usu.edu",
    "affiliation": {
      "@type": "Organization",
      "name": "Utah State University",
      "url": "www.usu.edu"
    }
  },
  "hasPart": {
    "@type": "CreativeWork",
    "name": "Great Salt Lake Bathymetry",
    "description": "Digital Elevation Model for the Great Salt Lake, lake bed bathymetry.",
    "identifier": "https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/582060f00f6b443bb26e896426d9f62a/"
  }
}
```

For the example above, multiple relations can be defined using a list.

``` json
{
  "@type": "CreativeWork",
  "name": "Collection of Great Salt Lake Data",
  "description": "Data from the Great Salt Lake and its basin",
  "identifier": "https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/b6c4fcad40c64c4cb4dd7d4a25d0db6e/",
  "creator":{
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "David Tarboton",
    "email": "david.tarboton@usu.edu",
    "affiliation": {
      "@type": "Organization",
      "name": "Utah State University",
      "url": "www.usu.edu"
    }
  },
  "hasPart": [
    {
      "@type": "CreativeWork",
      "name": "Great Salt Lake Bathymetry",
      "description": "Digital Elevation Model for the Great Salt Lake, lake bed bathymetry.",
      "identifier": "https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/582060f00f6b443bb26e896426d9f62a/"
    },
    {
      "@type": "CreativeWork",
      "name": "Great Salt Lake Level and Volume",
      "description": "Time series of level, area and volume in the Great Salt Lake.",
      "identifier": "https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/b26090299ec947c692d4ee4651815579/"
    }
  ]
}
```

**isPartOf** is the inverse property of **hasPart** and may be used to indicate
that a work is part of another collection of works. This can be read as: the "Great Salt Lake Bathymetry" 
record belongs to the "Collection of Great Salt Lake Data" creative work in the catalog.  

``` json
{
  "name": "Great Salt Lake Bathymetry",
  "description": "Digital Elevation Model for the Great Salt Lake, lake bed bathymetry.",
  "creator": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "David Tarboton",
    "email": "david.tarboton@usu.edu",
    "affiliation": {
      "@type": "Organization",
      "name": "Utah State University",
      "url": "www.usu.edu"
    }
  },
  "identifier": "https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/582060f00f6b443bb26e896426d9f62a/",
  "isPartOf": {
    "@type": "CreativeWork",
    "name": "Collection of Great Salt Lake Data",
    "description": "Data from the Great Salt Lake and its basin",
    "creator": {
      "@type": "Person",
      "name": "David Tarboton"
    },
    "identifier": "https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/b6c4fcad40c64c4cb4dd7d4a25d0db6e/"
  }
}
```

### Citation

In addition to `hasPart` and `isPartOf` that overall imply a specific collection/collected record relationship, 
[Schema:citation](https://schema.org/citation) can be used to represent general relationships between records. 
It can represent a citation or reference to another creative work, such as another publication, web page, scholarly article, etc. that 
are related but not necessarily part of a collection record. Note that `citation` is NOT used to encode the citation of the record being described.

This is a simple example of using `citation` to refer to a published article that used the "NOAA National Water Model CONUS Retrospective Dataset, Version 2.1 in NetCDF Format" dataset.

``` json
{
  "name": "NOAA National Water Model CONUS Retrospective Dataset, Version 2.1 in NetCDF Format",
  "description": "The complete archive of NWM input forcing and model output data version 2.1 in NetCDF format.",
  "url": "https://noaa-nwm-retrospective-2-1-pds.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html",
  "creator": {
    "@type" : "Organization",
    "name": "Office of Water Prediction (OWP)",
    "url": "https://water.noaa.gov/"
  },
  "citation": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2019.101526"
}
```

`citation` can also be expressed as a `creativework` to express more metadata of the item using sub-properties from `creativework`. Note that not all the authors of 
the cited article are listed in this example. 

``` json
{
  "name": "NOAA National Water Model CONUS Retrospective Dataset, Version 2.1 in NetCDF Format",
  "description": "The complete archive of NWM input forcing and model output data version 2.1 in NetCDF format.",
  "url": "https://noaa-nwm-retrospective-2-1-pds.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html",
  "creator": {
    "@type" : "Organization",
    "name": "Office of Water Prediction (OWP)",
    "url": "https://water.noaa.gov/"
  },
  "citation": {
    "@type": "CreativeWork",
    "name" : "Simulating storm surge and compound flooding events with a creek-to-ocean model: Importance of baroclinic effects",
    "identifier" : "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2019.101526",
    "url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1463500319302173?via%3Dihub",
    "creator" : {
      "@type" : "Person",
      "name": "Fei Ye",
      "email": "feiye@vims.edu",
      "affiliation": {
        "@type": "Organization",
        "name": "Virginia Institute of Marine Science",
        "url": "https://www.vims.edu"
      }
    },
    "creativeWorkStatus": {
      "@type": "DefinedTerm",
      "name": "published",
      "description": "The resource has been permanently published and should be considered final and complete."
    },
    "publisher" : {
      "@type": "Organization",
      "name" : "Elsevier"
    }
  } 
}
```

This example demonstrates the use of multiple citations, including a published article and a Jupyter notebook. Note that not all the authors of the cited article are listed in this example. 
 
``` json
{
  "name": "NOAA National Water Model CONUS Retrospective Dataset, Version 2.1 in NetCDF Format",
